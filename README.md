4-Bit Full Adder Lab Project
Description
This project implements a 4-bit full adder using Verilog. The adder takes two 4-bit binary numbers A and B, along with a carry-in Cin, and produces a 4-bit sum Sum and a carry-out Cout.

Features
Utilizes a one-bit full adder as a sub-module.
Displays the result on the Seven-Segment LED display of the Basys3 board.
